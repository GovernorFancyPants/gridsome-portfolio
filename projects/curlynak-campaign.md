# Curlynak

Curlynak is a sock brand born in Chamonix and manufactured in France. They make high quality socks for outdoor adventures including trail running, cycling and mountaineering. It's a family owned company who pride themselves in high quality and comfort above all.

### The campaign

For their new 2022 collection I helped them with a social media campaign showcasing their products. The campaign included photos and two videos to be used for social media and for product showcase.
