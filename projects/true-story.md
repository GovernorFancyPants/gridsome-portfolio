# True Story

True Story is a clothing brand based in Latvia with roots in the orienteering world. They make custom clothing for outdoor sports such as orienteering, cross-country skiing, trail running and more. All their products are made on-demand meaning more environmentally friendly since every single garment is made upon order.

### Kristoffer Hjärtström social media campaign

Kristoffer Hjärtström is a cross-country skier and an ambassador for True Story. I followed him on his journey towards Nordenskiöldsloppet winter season 2022. I created assets for social media in the form of photos and videos for True Story to use. His adventure from a novice skier to his big goal will be chronicled in a documentary coming soon.
