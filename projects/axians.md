Custom icon library, custom form elements

Icon pack created for the Qnet Self Service Portal. This is a cohesive set of icons used throughout the portal to maintain a familiar icon language. The icons were each carefully crafted to stay true to a legacy icon language, proprietary icons and also what is considered a standard set of icons. Along with actually designing the icons I also created a work flow for exporting them as a web font back when this was a new way of using icons.
