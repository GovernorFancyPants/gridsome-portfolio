# Qnet

Qnet is a self service portal for customers of Axians and also for internal use of things like ticket handling, monetary overview, orders and lots more. I worked on this project for several years and it evolved over time and more and more features were added. This in turn has required the design and usability to change and grow organically along with the feature set. I implemented tools to make this evolution easier and set standards to make the process easier for each iteration. ​​​​​​

It was a demanding interface because of the users different perspectives, what seems logical for one user may not be applicable for another. The portal has lots of integrations with other systems such as Azure, ticket system, computer inventory system, documentation and so on. My biggest challenge was to make a cohesive interface for such a diverse set of features which kept on evolving over time.

# Custom icons

I was tasked to create a cohesive set of icons used throughout the portal to maintain a familiar icon language. The icons were each carefully crafted to stay true to a legacy icon language, proprietary icons and also what is considered a standard set of icons. Along with actually designing the icons I also created a work flow for exporting them as a web font back when this was a new way of using icons.
